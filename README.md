# Board Meet

BoardMeet is a `Node`-based web real-time communication application that provides a seamless video calling experience, allowing you to connect with colleagues, friends, or clients from anywhere in the world. 

Our platform also features an integrated in-call chat, enabling real-time messaging during video calls. Additionally, we offer a dynamic whiteboard feature to facilitate collaborative work. The interactive whiteboard serves as a virtual canvas where you can draw, write, and share media elements.
